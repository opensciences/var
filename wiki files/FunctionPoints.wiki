A function point is a unit of measurement to express the amount of business functionality an information system provides to a user. The cost (in dollars or hours) of a single unit is calculated from past projects.

For software effort estimation,
many have advocated (e.g. [Albrecht Albrecht and Gaffney]) the use of function points instead of SLOC as a measure of functionality.
(but note that  since function points are highly correlated to SLOC, and cannot be automatically measured, this is not a universally held view).

For more on functions points, see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_point their Wikipedia page].
