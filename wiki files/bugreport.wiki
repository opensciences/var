= About the Data =

== Short description of the data sources ==

The data files have been extracted from the eclipse, gnome, and mozilla bug repositories (many thanks goes to all the contributors of these projects). The data is until the year 2009.

Each row denotes the values extracted from one bug report. For each of the bug report attributes (listed below), we obtained the values at different points in time: current entry, the first entry (when the bug was reported), and the entries/measures after 1,3,7,14, and 30 days after the bug has been reported.
