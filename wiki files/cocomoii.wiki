Several data sets in PROMISE use data in the Cocomo81 format:
  * [cocomosdr]

The COCOMO software cost model measures effort in calendar months of 152
hours (and includes development and management hours). COCOMO assumes that
the effort grows more than linearly on software size; i.e. `months=a{{{*}}}
KSLOC^b{{{*}}}c`. Here, "a" and "b" are domain-specific parameters; "KSLOC"
is estimated directly or computed from a function point analysis; and
"c" is the product of over a dozen "effort multipliers". I.e.

Exponential Cost Drivers (contributes to "b")
  *			PREC: Precedentedness 
  *			FLEX: Development Flexibility 
  *			RESL: Arch/Risk Resolution 
  *			TEAM: Team Cohesion 
  *			PMAT: Process Maturity 

Product Factors (contributes to "c")
  *			RELY: Required Software Reliability
  *			DATA: Database Size 
  *			CPLX: Product Complexity 
  *			RUSE: Required Reusability 
  *			DOCU: Documentation match to life-cycle needs

Platform Factors (contributes to "c")
  *		TIME: Execution Time Constraint 
  *			STOR: Main Storage Constraint 
  *			PVOL: Platform Volatility 

Personnel Factors (contributes to "c")
  *			ACAP: Analyst Capability 
  *			PCAP: Programmer Capability 
  *			PCON: Personnel Continuity 
  *			AEXP: Applications Experience 
  *			PEXP: Platform Experience 
  *			LTEX: Language and Tool Experience

Project Factors (contributes to "c")
  *			TOOL: Use of Soft. Tools
  *			SITE: Multisite Development 
  *			SCED: Development Schedule 

Input:
  *			LOC:Lines of Code

Output:
  *			ACTUAL EFFORT: Effort spent for project in terms of man month
