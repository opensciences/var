=Halstead Metrics=

The Halstead metrics falls into three groups: 
  # the base measures, 
  # the derived measures, 
  # and lines of code measures.

  * Base measures: 
    * mu1 = number of unique operators
    * mu2             = number of unique operands
    * N1              = total occurrences of operators
    * N2              = total occurrences of operands
    * length     = N  = N1 + N2
    * vocabulary = mu = mu1 + mu2
    * Constants set for each function:
      * mu1' =  potential operator count (just the function name and the "return" operator)
      * mu2'      = potential operand count (the number of arguments to the module)  

      
For example, the expression "return max(w+x,x+y)" has "N1=4" operators "return, max, +,+)", "N2=4" operands (w,x,x,y), "mu1=3" unique operators (return, max,+), and "mu2=3" unique operands (w,x,y).


  * Derived measures:
    * P = volume = V = N _x_ log2(mu) (the number of mental comparisons needed to write a program of length N)
    * V`*` = volume on minimal implementation = (2 + mu2') _x_ log2(2 + mu2')
    * L  = program length = V`*`/N
    * D  = difficulty = 1/L
    * L' = 1/D 
    * I  = intelligence = L' _x_ V'
    * E  = effort to write program = V/L 
    * T  = time to write program = E/18 seconds
