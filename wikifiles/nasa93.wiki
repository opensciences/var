This is a cross-listed data set that contains effort _and_ defect information.

This data uses the attributes defined in the [cocomo81] model.

== Past Usage ==

 * None with this specific data set. But for older work on similar data, see:
   * "Validation Methods for Calibrating Software Effort Models", T. Menzies and D. Port and Z. Chen and J. Hihn and S. Stukes, Proceedings ICSE 2005, http://menzies.us/pdf/04coconut.pdf
   * Results:
     * Given background knowledge on 60 prior projects, a new cost model can be tuned to local data using as little as 20 new projects.
     * A very simple calibration method (COCONUT) can achieve PRED(30)=7% or PRED(20)=50% (after 20 projects).  These are results seen in 30 repeats of an incremental cross-validation study.
     * Two cost models are compared; one based on just lines of code and one using over a dozen "effort multipliers". Just using lines of code loses 10 to 20 PRED(N) points.

 * Additional Usage:
   * "Feature Subset Selection Can Improve Software Cost Estimation Accuracy" Zhihao Chen, Tim Menzies, Dan Port and Barry Boehm Proceedings PROMISE Workshop 2005, http://www.etechstyle.com/chen/papers/05fsscocomo.pdf P02, P03, P04 are used in this paper.
   * Results
     * To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of applying feature subset selection (FSS) to software effort data.
     * FSS can dramatically improve cost estimation.
     * T-tests are applied to the results to demonstrate that always in our data sets, removing attributes improves performance without increasing the variance in model behavior.
